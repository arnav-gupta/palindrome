Steps to run the project

Step 1: Clone repository
Install git from https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git . Clone repository to your local system. 

Step 2: Ensure Nodejs and NPM are Installed

You need to ensure that Nodejs and NPM are installed. They're 2 separate entities, however, when you install Nodejs, NPM is installed automatically.

You can install Nodejs by visiting their official website here (https://nodejs.org/en/).

Step 3: Use "npm install" to install the packages

Use the Node js command line to run the following:

npm install

Note: You must be in the same folder where project files/repository are placed/cloned.

Running "npm install" will fetch and install all of the necessary dependencies that are specified in the configuration files. They'll reside in a folder called "node_modules". You won't have to tamper with this folder or the contents of this folder.


Step 4: Run "npm start"
This should open a webpage on browser with http://localhost:3000
